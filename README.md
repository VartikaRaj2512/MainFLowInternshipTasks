Task1:
This project involves analyzing a real-world student performance dataset using Python to uncover key insights about academic outcomes. Using libraries like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn, the data was loaded, cleaned, and explored to answer specific questions such as the average final grade (G3), number of students scoring above 15, correlation between study time and final grade, and performance comparison by gender. The analysis included creating informative visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts to support the findings. Through this task, I strengthened my skills in data manipulation, basic statistical analysis, and effective storytelling through visualizations and markdown documentation
