# MainFlowInternshipTasks

Task1:
This project involves analyzing a real-world student performance dataset using Python to uncover key insights about academic outcomes. Using libraries like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn, the data was loaded, cleaned, and explored to answer specific questions such as the average final grade (G3), number of students scoring above 15, correlation between study time and final grade, and performance comparison by gender. The analysis included creating informative visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts to support the findings. Through this task, I strengthened my skills in data manipulation, basic statistical analysis, and effective storytelling through visualizations and markdown documentation

### **DataAnalysisWithSqlTask1** 📊🧑‍🎓

This project, **DataAnalysisWithSqlTask1**, focuses on implementing a basic **Student Management System** using **SQL** within a **Python environment on Google Colab** 🐍💻. It demonstrates essential SQL operations such as creating a database 🏗️ and table 📋, inserting sample student data 👥, and performing various data analysis queries 🔍. These include calculating average subject scores 📐, identifying top-performing students 🥇, comparing performance by gender ⚖️, and analyzing grade distribution 🎓. The project uses **SQLite** for database handling 🗃️ and **Pandas** for displaying results in a structured tabular format 📑, offering a hands-on approach to understanding SQL-based data manipulation and analysis 🔧📈.
